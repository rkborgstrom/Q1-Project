# Q1-Project

Project description

I am creating a web application that will allow users to find a pool near their current location. This is solving the problem of people not having their own pool that still want their own privacy as opposed to going to the public pool. 
My application will allow these users to rent someoneâ€™s pool for x amount of hours. It will also allow users to find reviews, pricing, as well as photos of the pools. The application will input the weather and specific location. I am implementing a weather forecast so users can plan their day in advance, as well as location to find pools nearby. It is going to output this API data and display the weather on the page. I have received a weather API key for a 5-day forecast from: https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys. To build this, I will use HTML, JS, and CSS. I am hoping to include Bootstrap framework.
